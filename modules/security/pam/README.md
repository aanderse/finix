NOTES
- currently the `nixos` pam module depends on too many modules and needs to be properly broken up
- this isn't the direction `finix` is taking so the `pam` module is seriously lacking at the moment
- the `nixos` pam module is heading in a good direction for `finix` with its `rules` options, though
